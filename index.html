The most adopted suggestion to improve by the APA:

- No reliance on Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (Cumming, 2014)

- In its place, use **Effect Sizes** and **Confidence Intervals**

.pull-left[
A series of regressions (path analysis):

$$
Y = c_0 + b_1 M + c'_1 X + e_1
$$

$$
M = a_0 + a_1 X + e_2
$$

Used extensively in Prevention Science research

- Info on *how* a variable affects another
- Info on *individual paths* and *entire process*
- Info on *actionable targets of intervention*

# But...

When the mediator and/or outcome is **categorical/non-normal**, mediation analysis does not have:

- intuitive interpretation
- defined effect sizes (indirect or total)
- meaningful confidence intervals

--

**Why?**

![](fig_binarymediator.jpg)

???
How do we combine logistic and OLS coefficients?

Generally, we are looking at the **marginal effect** of a variable on another (it is additive)

To have any meaningful interpretation, need additive

Adjusting to Odds Ratios doesn't help (it creates a multiplicitive effect instead of additive)

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i

The marginal effect of, say, `\(X_1\)` is:
$$
\frac{\delta Y}{\delta X_1} = \beta_1
$$
]

.pull-right[

#### Logistic Regression

$$
logit(Y) = \beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i
$$
$$
log(\frac{Prob(Y = 1)}{1 - Prob(Y = 1)}) = \beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i
$$

$$
\frac{Prob(Y = 1)}{1 - Prob(Y = 1)} = e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i}

$$
Prob(Y = 1) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i}}
$$

The marginal effect of, say, `\(X_1\)` is:
$$
\frac{\delta Y}{\delta X_1} = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i}}{(1 + e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i})^2}

The derivative (marginal effect) generally depends on the values of the covariates

To simply combine effects, like in linear regression, we need the estimate to be **additive**

# Average Marginal Effects

The *average* of the marginal effects (Bartus, 2005):

--

.pull-left[
#### Definition: Continuous Variable
$$
AME_k = \beta_k \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n f(\beta x_i)
$$
where `\(f\)` is the derivative of the estimate with respect to `\(x_i\)`, the `\(\beta x_i\)` is the linear combination of the predictors, and `\(AME_k\)` is the average marginal effect for the `\(kth\)` variable. 
]

--

.pull-right[
#### Definition: Dummy Coded Variable
$$
AME_{k} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n [ F(\beta x_i | x_i = 1) - F(\beta x_i | x_i = 0) ]
$$
where `\(F(\beta x_i | x_i = 1)\)` is the predicted value of the `\(ith\)` observation when the dummy variable equals one and `\(F(\beta x_i | x_i = 0)\)` is the predicted value when the dummy value equals zero. 
]

--

&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
.center[.large[*Intuitive, interpretable effect size measures with meaningful confidence intervals*? &lt;/br&gt; Yes.]]

???
Since the derivative (marginal effect) generally depends on the values of the covariates

*What values should we use to get the marginal effect then?*

AME uses **the actual values** and then averages across all individuals

# Average Marginal Effects

.large[*intuitive* -- they are in the original metric of the dependent variable]

.large[*interpretable* -- they refer to the change in the dependent variable for a one unit change in the independent]

.large[*meaningful confidence intervals* -- using bootstrapping (used here) or the delta method]

# Interpretation

Since this method can handle all sorts of combinations of variable types, here are some interpretation guidelines.

### Principle 1: The individual paths are interpreted based on the corresponding endogenous variable's original metric.

--
### Principle 2: The indirect effect, as a combination of the a and b paths, are interpreted based on the outcome's original metric.

--
### Principle 3: Both the direct and total effects are interpreted based on the outcome's original metric.

&lt;/br&gt;
Two *considerations* for each type of mediator/outcome variable (multinomial, count, ordinal, dichotomous): 

1. Need a way to integrate *moderation* (interaction effects) into the framework. 
    - Interactions with marginal effects are more complex.
1. Generally, 
$$
a * b + c' \neq c
$$
in non-linear models (it does equal in linear models; MacKinnon, Chapter 11). It is expected that these will equal (approx.) within the Marginal Mediation framework, but needs to be assessed.

???
Total effect does not equal total effect! This is a problem.

# Monte Carlo Simulation

#### The "a" Path Population Model 
- where the `\(Prob(M = 1)\)` is a latent continuous variable with a linear or logistic relationship with the predictors
- the `\(e_i\)` is normally distributed with `\(M = 0\)` and `\(SD = 1\)`.
$$
Prob(M = 1)_i = a_0 + a_1 x_c + a_2 x_d + e_i
$$
The observed variable, `\(M_i\)`, is defined as follows: `\(M_i = 0\)` if `\(Prob(M = 1) &lt; .5\)` and `\(M_i = 1\)` otherwise.

--

&lt;/br&gt;
#### The "b" and "c'" Path Population Model
$$
Y_i = b_0 + b_1 M_i + c'_1 x_c + c'_2 x_d + e_i
$$
where this `\(e_i\)` also is normally distributed with `\(M = 0\)` and `\(SD = 1\)`.

- `\(x_c\)` is a continuous predictor
- `\(x_d\)` is a dummy coded predictor

# Conclusions

.large[Ultimately, this project will produce:

1. A new approach to mediation analysis that applies across a wide variety of situations

1. Guidelines for using the approach in finite samples

1. An example of the approach on prevention data

1. More evidence about the link between chronic physical conditions and poor behavioral outcomes
