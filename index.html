# Reproducibility

#### Three Types:

1. **Methods**: replicate results with *same methods and data*

1. **Results**: replicate results with same methods and *independent data*

1. **Inference**: replicate *inference* with same methods and same or independent data

# Reproducibility

.pull-left[
**"Reproducibility Crisis"**

Many recommendations to improve.

The most adopted suggestion by the APA:

- No reliance on Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (Cumming, 2014)
- In its place, use *Effect Sizes* and *Confidence Intervals*

# Reproducibility and Mediation Analysis

.mlarge[The APA, in general, recommends using **effect sizes and confidence intervals**]

--

*Mediation Analysis*:
- Lacks intuitive and interpretable effect sizes in many situations (e.g., when mediator/outcome is nominal, ordinal, count, or binary)
--

- *Limits its utility and raises questions about best practices*

# Mediation Analysis

.pull-left[
A series of regressions (path analysis)

Simplest situation shown below (equations) and at right (figure):

$$
Y = c_0 + b_1 M + c'_1 X + e_1
$$

$$
M = a_0 + a_1 X + e_2
$$

Used extensively in prevention science research

Info on *individual paths* and *entire process*

# But...

When the mediator and/or outcome is categorical/non-normal, mediation analysis does not have:

- intuitive interpretation
- defined effect sizes (indirect or total)
- meaningful confidence intervals

--

**Why?**

![](fig_binarymediator.jpg)

???
How do we combine logistic and OLS coefficients?

Adjusting to Odds Ratios doesn't help (it creates a multiplicitive effect instead of additive)

Ultimately, to combine the paths, we need to be able to say the change for a one unit change in the predictor.

# Why the big fuss?

.pull-left[
#### Linear Model

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i
$$

The marginal effect of, say, `\(X_1\)` is:
$$
\frac{\delta Y}{\delta X_1} = \beta_1
$$
]

--

.pull-right[

#### Logistic Regression

$$
logit(Y) = \beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i
$$
$$
log(\frac{Prob(Y = 1)}{1 - Prob(Y = 1)}) = \beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i
$$

$$
\frac{Prob(Y = 1)}{1 - Prob(Y = 1)} = e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i}
$$

$$
Prob(Y = 1) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i}}
$$

The marginal effect of, say, `\(X_1\)` is:
$$
\frac{\delta Y}{\delta X_1} = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i}}{(1 + e^{\beta_0 + \sum_j^p \beta_j X_j + e_i})^2}
$$
]

???
The derivative (marginal effect) generally depends on the values of the covariates

To simply combine effects, like in linear regression, we need the estimate to be **additive**

# Average Marginal Effects

The *average* of the marginal effects -- it is a post-estimation approach (Bartus, 2005):

--

.pull-left[
#### Definition: Continuous Variable
$$
AME_k = \beta_k \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n f(\beta x_i)
$$
where `\(f\)` is the derivative of the estimate with respect to `\(x_i\)`, the `\(\beta x_i\)` is the linear combination of the predictors, and `\(AME_k\)` is the average marginal effect for the `\(kth\)` variable. 
]

--

.pull-right[
#### Definition: Dummy Coded Variable
$$
AME_{k} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n [ F(\beta x_i | x_i = 1) - F(\beta x_i | x_i = 0) ]
$$
where `\(F(\beta x_i | x_i = 1)\)` is the predicted value of the `\(ith\)` observation when the dummy variable equals one and `\(F(\beta x_i | x_i = 0)\)` is the predicted value when the dummy value equals zero. 
]

--

&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
.center[.large[*Intuitive, interpretable effect size measures with meaningful confidence intervals*? &lt;/br&gt; Yes.]]

???
Since the derivative (marginal effect) generally depends on the values of the covariates

*What values should we use to get the marginal effect then?*

AME uses **the actual values** and then averages across all individuals

---
# Average Marginal Effects

.large[*intuitive* -- they are in the original metric of the dependent variable]

.large[*interpretable* -- they refer to the change in the dependent variable for a one unit change in the independent]

.large[*meaningful confidence intervals* -- using bootstrapping (used here) or the delta method]

--

.center[
.large[*Again, these qualities are lacking in mediation analysis.*] &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
So... (Punchline) &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

# Marginal Mediation

# Marginal Mediation 

.mlarge[It is three step approach]

1. Estimate the mediation model (via OLS or GLM)
1. Compute the average marginal effects of each path
1. Estimate each effect (each path is additive)

#### Example with Binary Mediator and Count Outcome

![](fig_combining.jpg)

# Interpretation

Since this method can handle all sorts of combinations of variable types, here are some interpretation guidelines.

### Principle 1: The individual paths are interpreted based on the corresponding endogenous variable's original metric.

--
### Principle 2: The indirect effect, as a combination of the a and b paths, are interpreted based on the outcome's original metric.

--
### Principle 3: Both the direct and total effects are interpreted based on the outcome's original metric.

---
# Assumptions

.left-column[
### The same assumptions as linear models or generalized linear models hold.

&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
.large[#### Only additional assumption with AME:]

1. Correct distribution (normal in linear models)

1. Proper variance (homoskedastic in linear models)

1. Linear in parameters

1. Random sample

1. No measurement error

1. No omitted influences

&lt;/br&gt;

.large[#### Marginal effect can be described *additively* (after accounting for all the covariates)]

# Proposed Methods

## 1. Development

- to develop the approach and the software

## 2. Monte Carlo Simulation Study

- to understand the finite sampling properties, develop guidelines

## 3. Application Study

- to apply Marginal Mediation to prevention data

&lt;/br&gt;
Two considerations for each type of mediator/outcome variable (multinomial, count, ordinal, dichotomous): 

1. Need a way to integrate moderation (interaction effects) into the framework. 
    - Interactions with marginal effects are more complex.
1. Generally, 
$$
a * b + c' \neq c
$$
in non-linear models (it does equal in linear models; MacKinnon, Chapter 11). It is expected that these will equal (approx.) within the Marginal Mediation framework, but needs to be assessed.

???
Total effect does not equal total effect! This is a problem.

# Monte Carlo Simulation

#### The "a" Path Population Model 
- where the `\(Prob(M = 1)\)` is a latent continuous variable with a linear or logistic relationship with the predictors
- the `\(e_i\)` is normally distributed with `\(M = 0\)` and `\(SD = 1\)`.
$$
Prob(M = 1)_i = a_0 + a_1 x_c + a_2 x_d + e_i
$$
The observed variable, `\(M_i\)`, is defined as follows: `\(M_i = 0\)` if `\(Prob(M = 1) &lt; .5\)` and `\(M_i = 1\)` otherwise.

--

&lt;/br&gt;
#### The "b" and "c'" Path Population Model
$$
Y_i = b_0 + b_1 M_i + c'_1 x_c + c'_2 x_d + e_i
$$
