# What is Mediation Analysis? Why is it important?

A series of regressions (path analysis):

$$
Y = c_0 + b_1 M + c'_1 X + e_1
$$

$$
M = a_0 + a_1 X + e_2
$$

Used extensively in Prevention Science research

- Info on *how* a variable affects another
- Info on *individual paths* and *entire process*
- Info on *actionable targets of intervention*

# But...

When the mediator and/or outcome is **categorical/non-normal**, mediation analysis does not have:

- intuitive interpretation
- defined effect sizes (indirect or total)
- meaningful confidence intervals

--

**Why?**

![](fig_binarymediator.jpg)

???
How do we combine logistic and OLS coefficients?

Generally, we are looking at the **marginal effect** of a variable on another (it is additive)

To have any meaningful interpretation, need additive

Adjusting to Odds Ratios doesn't help (it creates a multiplicitive effect instead of additive)

# Average Marginal Effects

The *average* of the marginal effects (Bartus, 2005):

--

.pull-left[
#### Definition: Continuous Variable
$$
AME_k = \beta_k \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n f(\beta x_i)
$$
where $f$ is the derivative of the estimate with respect to $x_i$, the $\beta x_i$ is the linear combination of the predictors, and $AME_k$ is the average marginal effect for the $kth$ variable. 
]

--

.pull-right[
#### Definition: Dummy Coded Variable
$$
AME_{k} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i^n [ F(\beta x_i | x_i = 1) - F(\beta x_i | x_i = 0) ]
$$
where $F(\beta x_i | x_i = 1)$ is the predicted value of the $ith$ observation when the dummy variable equals one and $F(\beta x_i | x_i = 0)$ is the predicted value when the dummy value equals zero. 
]

.center[.large[*Intuitive, interpretable effect size measures with meaningful confidence intervals*? </br> Yes.]]

???
Since the derivative (marginal effect) generally depends on the values of the covariates

*What values should we use to get the marginal effect then?*

AME uses **the actual values** and then averages across all individuals

# Average Marginal Effects

.large[*intuitive* -- they are in the original metric of the dependent variable]

.large[*interpretable* -- they refer to the change in the dependent variable for a one unit change in the independent]

# Interpretation

Since this method can handle all sorts of combinations of variable types, here are some interpretation guidelines.

### Principle 1: The individual paths are interpreted based on the corresponding endogenous variable's original metric.

--
### Principle 2: The indirect effect, as a combination of the a and b paths, are interpreted based on the outcome's original metric.

--
### Principle 3: Both the direct and total effects are interpreted based on the outcome's original metric.

</br>
Two *considerations* for each type of mediator/outcome variable (multinomial, count, ordinal, dichotomous): 

1. Need a way to integrate *moderation* (interaction effects) into the framework. 
    - Interactions with marginal effects are more complex.
1. Generally, 
$$
a * b + c' \neq c
$$
in non-linear models (it does equal in linear models; MacKinnon, Chapter 11). It is expected that these will equal (approx.) within the Marginal Mediation framework, but needs to be assessed.

???
Total effect does not equal total effect! This is a problem.

# Monte Carlo Simulation

#### The "a" Path Population Model 
- where the $Prob(M = 1)$ is a latent continuous variable with a linear or logistic relationship with the predictors
- the $e_i$ is normally distributed with $M = 0$ and $SD = 1$.
$$
Prob(M = 1)_i = a_0 + a_1 x_c + a_2 x_d + e_i
$$
The observed variable, $M_i$, is defined as follows: $M_i = 0$ if $Prob(M = 1) < .5$ and $M_i = 1$ otherwise.

--

</br>
#### The "b" and "c'" Path Population Model
$$
Y_i = b_0 + b_1 M_i + c'_1 x_c + c'_2 x_d + e_i
$$
where this $e_i$ also is normally distributed with $M = 0$ and $SD = 1$.

- $x_c$ is a continuous predictor
- $x_d$ is a dummy coded predictor
